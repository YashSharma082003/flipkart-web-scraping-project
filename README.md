# flipkart-web-scraping-project

This is my Flipkart web scrapping project. In this project, I scraped smartphones under 50000 from the Flipkart website. I used those packages: 
* Requests — for downloading the HTML code from the TMDB URL 
* BeautifulSoup4 — for extracting data from the HTML string 
* Pandas — to gather my data into a data frame for further processing
